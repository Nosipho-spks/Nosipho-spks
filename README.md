Hi, Iâ€™m NosiphoðŸ‘‹ <br>
I use HTML, CSS Javascript and Bootstrap for programming and web development.<br>
I have practiced in the fields of sustainable environmental management and human resource management.<br>
I have a curious mind that led me to learn programming and web development.<br>
I'm always eager to learn new skills and technologies and look forward to learning from and collaborating with others.<br>
Asides that, I enjoy hiking and exploring nature.<br>
